        ## Test Coverage
        
        - ✅ Code formatting (rustfmt)
        - ✅ Linting (clippy)
        - ✅ Headless builds
        - ✅ Unit and integration tests
        - ✅ Documentation generation
        - ✅ Release builds
        - ✅ CLI functionality
        - ✅ Circuit file processing
        - ✅ GUI compilation checks
        
        ## Notes
        
        - All tests run in headless mode to ensure CI compatibility
        - GUI features are compilation-tested but not runtime-tested in CI
        - Circuit file loading tests expect some failures due to unsupported components
        - Performance checks are basic and informational only
