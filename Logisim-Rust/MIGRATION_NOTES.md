# Migration Notes: Java to Rust

This document outlines the migration strategy and progress from the Java-based Logisim-Evolution to the Rust-based Logisim-RUST implementation.

> **Note**: This is a placeholder file for the workspace setup. For detailed migration documentation, see [docs/MIGRATION_NOTES.md](./docs/MIGRATION_NOTES.md).

## Migration Overview

The Logisim-RUST project aims to provide a modern, memory-safe, and high-performance implementation of the Logisim digital logic simulator while maintaining full compatibility with existing Logisim-Evolution projects.

## Key Migration Goals

### 1. Functional Compatibility
- **File Format**: 100% compatibility with `.circ` files
- **Component Behavior**: Identical simulation results
- **User Interface**: Familiar workflow and feature set

### 2. Technical Improvements
- **Memory Safety**: Eliminate segfaults and memory leaks through Rust's ownership system
- **Performance**: 2-3x faster simulation through native compilation and zero-cost abstractions
- **Cross-Platform**: Single binary deployment without JVM dependency
- **Web Support**: WebAssembly target for browser-based simulation

### 3. Maintainability
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time error detection
- **Modern Tooling**: Cargo ecosystem and package management
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with property-based testing

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Core Architecture**: Basic workspace structure established
- ‚úÖ **File Parsing**: `.circ` file reading and writing
- ‚úÖ **GUI Framework**: egui-based interface foundation
- ‚úÖ **Build System**: Cargo workspace with CI/CD
- üöß **Component Library**: Standard gates and components (in progress)
- üöß **Simulation Engine**: Logic simulation kernel (in progress)
- ‚è≥ **Advanced Features**: Memory blocks, subcircuits, etc. (planned)

## Crate Organization

The migration follows a modular approach with clear separation of concerns:

```
logisim_core/     ‚Üí Core simulation and data structures
logisim_formats/  ‚Üí File format handling (new separation)
logisim_ui/       ‚Üí User interface (egui-based)
logisim_cli/      ‚Üí Command-line tools (new addition)
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Phase 1**: Workspace setup and basic infrastructure ‚úÖ
2. **Phase 2**: Core simulation engine migration üöß
3. **Phase 3**: Component library completion
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features and optimization
5. **Phase 5**: Testing and validation
