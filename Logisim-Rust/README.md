A modern Rust implementation of the Logisim digital logic simulator with native GUI using egui.

## ðŸŽ‰ Version 1.0.0 Release

This is the first official release of Logisim-RUST! This version provides a solid foundation for digital logic design and simulation with modern Rust performance and safety.

### ðŸ“¦ Downloads

**Pre-built binaries coming soon with release process!**

For now, build from source using the instructions below.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.70+ (latest stable recommended)
- For GUI builds: Display server (X11, Wayland, or Windows/macOS native)

### Building

```bash
# Clone and navigate
git clone https://github.com/crossplatformdev/Logisim-RUST.git
cd Logisim-RUST/Logisim-Rust

# Build (headless mode - CI compatible)
cargo build --workspace

# Build with GUI support
cargo build --workspace --features gui

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run with GUI
cargo run --package logisim_ui --features gui
```

### Using Just (Recommended)

```bash
# Install just task runner
cargo install just

# Show all available commands
just

# Development workflow
just ci           # Run all CI checks (format, lint, test)
just build-gui    # Build with GUI features
just test         # Run all tests
just run-gui      # Run with GUI
